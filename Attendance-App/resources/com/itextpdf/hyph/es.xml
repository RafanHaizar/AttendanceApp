% Hyphenation patterns for Spanish.
% Compiled by Julio Sanchez (jsanchez@gmv.es) on September 1991.
%
% These patterns have been derived from "On Word Division in Spanish",
% Jos� A. Ma�as, Communications of the ACM, and implemented in his
% package ftc. You can get ftc and a draft of the abovementioned
% paper from goya.dit.upm.es in src/text.proc/ftc.Z. FTP access may
% be available. Otherwise, send help to info@goya.dit.upm.es for
% details on use of the mail server.
%
% Rules mentioned below are those described in that paper. After
% several unsatisfactory attempts to pretend I knew better, these 
% patterns closely follow that paper. Pattern 'tl' is not considered. 
% It is conflictive and ftc does not use it either.
%
% These patterns have been generated by shyphen.sh version 1.2, 
% shyphen.sh is a sh script that allows a number of choices. 
% Full benefit from some of these options can only be
% obtained if appropriate fonts are available.
%
% Follows a copyright notice. This is not in the public domain,
% but the copyright is essentially a hold-harmless clause. That
% is, use it at will, but don't sue me if you don't like it.

%			COPYRIGHT NOTICE
%
% These patterns and the generating sh script are Copyright (c) GMV 1991
% These patterns were developed for internal GMV use and are made
% public in the hope that they will benefit others. Also, spreading
% these patterns throughout the Spanish-language TeX community is
% expected to provide back-benefits to GMV in that it can help keeping
% GMV in the mainstream of spanish users. However, this is given

% send any changes to tex@gmv.es. If you change the generating 
% script, you must include code in it such that any output is clearly

% Options included in this set: basic TeX
% Open vowels: a e o 'a 'e 'i 'o 'u
% Closed vowels: i u "u
% Consonants: b c d f g j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z ~n
%
% Some of the patterns below represent combinations that never
% happen in Spanish. Would they happen, they would be hyphenated
% according to the rules.

% This keeps {cat|lc}code changes, if any, local. Nice to users of
% multilingual versions. These are the minimum changes needed to process
% the patterns. These and other changes will have to be re-enacted when
% Spanish be established as the current language. See the babel docs if
% you don't understand this.
